# Computer Science Assignment
This readme file contains the requirements for your assignment. The objectives are: 

1. Define a **clustering** problem. 
2. Implement a clustering algorithm in Python using libraries such as sciKit. 
3. Document the algorithm you implemented. 

Clustering is one of the most relevant problems in machine learning. You can find all relevant information about clustering [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

Your assignment must comply with the following **requirements**:
- The problem definition must be linked to a management problem in any of these business processes: marketing, sales, procurement, product design, manufacturing, or logistics
- The assignment must include a dataset obtained for instance from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=clustering+in%3Adatasets)
- The algorithm implementation may be based on an available implementation found in Kaggle (linked to the dataset), not necessarily written from scratch
- The algorithm description must include a flow diagram of the algorithm
- The algorithm description must include relevant references and links to related sources
- The assignment must be handled as a Jupyter Notebook

Your grading will be based on the following **criteria**:
- Originality: Your problem definition and implementation is relevant and original among the different groups
- Explainability: Your algorithm is well documented and described
- Presenation: The Notebook makes a good use of the different formatting options and is well described
