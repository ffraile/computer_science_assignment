# Computer Science Assignment
This readme file contains the requirements for your assignment. The objectives are: 

1. Implement a **prime number generator** in Python. 
2. Document the algorithm you implemented. 

 You can find some relevant information about prime number generators here [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

Your assignment must comply with the following **requirements**:
- The source code must be hosted in a Github repository
- Given an integer number (n), the code must generate the sequence of prime numbers that are less or equal than n
- The implementation may be based on an available implementation, not necessarily written from scratch
- The algorithm description must include a flow diagram of the algorithm
- The algorithm description must include relevant references and links to related sources
- The assignment must be handled as a Jupyter Notebook

Your grading will be based on the following **criteria**:
- Management: Your team uses software project management tools appropiately and thre is evidence of team work
- Originality: Your problem definition and implementation is relevant and original among the different groups
- Explainability: Your algorithm is well documented and described
- Presenation: The Notebook makes a good use of the different formatting options and is well described
